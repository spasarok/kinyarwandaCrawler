Kamonyi: couple celebrates achievement over charcoal stoves making.
Some of the already forged charcoal stoves.
For Donatien Bugenimana and his wife Nyiranzeyimana starting from scratches to forge charcoal stoves in parts of iron sheets and drums for the last 3 years has been real success and gave employment to 4 people.
This family forges charcoal stoves in Ruyenzi cell in Runda sector in Kamonyi district. The couple buys all aluminum, bits and pieces of iron sheets and they are satisfied with what they are doing.
The couple that has been forging the cooking stoves for 3 years started this work in Kigali city and moved to Ruyenzi cell after buying a plot of land in this area and shifted with their business.
The cooking charcoal stoves forged by this hard working couple are in much demand. They solicited help by employing 4 more people to meet the demand of their clients and together, they are seeing their market grow day to day.
The team is required to forge about 100 charcoal stoves to send to the base in Kigali city in order to supply to their growing market but this is not normally possible. Since they need to find bits and pieces of iron sheets and clay, they get what is left from construction sites and are not often available.
“Sometimes we fail to get the pieces of iron sheets but we cannot find enough of them and buying new iron sheets would put us in losses” says Bugenimana.
There is not established amount of money they buy the pieces of the remaining iron sheets; they get to bargain with the owners. The clay used in one stove is bought at Rwf300; the charcoal stove is worth Rwf800 and sold between Rwf1200 and Rwf1500 depending on the size.
This couple says they decided on forging charcoal stoves and they are maintaining their family on this skill. They rent a home they live in, pay workers, they bought the plot of land and are planning on constructing their own house soon.
